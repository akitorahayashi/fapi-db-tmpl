This directory is reserved for tests that verify interactions between
components, services, or external dependencies. Currently, API endpoint
tests have been moved to tests/e2e/ for better organization.

Add interaction tests here when needed, such as:
- Component-to-component communication
- External service integrations
- Cross-cutting concerns
